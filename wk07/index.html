    <b>Digital Forensics Examination Protocol</b>
        <ol>
            <li>First, conduct your investigation of the digital evidence with one GUI tool</li>
            <li>Then perform the same investigation with a disk editor to verify that the GUI tool is seeing the same digital evidence in the same places on the test / suspect drive's image.</li>
            <li>If a file is recovered, obtain the hash value with the GUI tool and the disk editor, and then compare the results to verify whether the file has the same value in both tools.</li>
        </ol>

<h2>06.05 Chapter Review</h2>
    <h3>06.05a Chapter Summary</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Consult your business plan to get the best hardware and software solution for your digital investigation needs.</li>

    <li>The functions required for digital forensics tools are acquisition, validation and verification, extraction, reconstruction, and reporting.</li>
        
    <li>For your forensics lab, you should create a software library for older versions of forensics utilities, OSs, and applications and maintain older versions of software you have used and retired, such as previous versions of Windows and Linux. In addition, vendors merge or go out of business, so maintaining a backup copy of their tools might come in handy.</li>
        
    <li>Some forensics tools run in a command-line interface, including those that can find file slack and free space, recover data, and search by keyword. They’re designed to run in minimal configurations and can fit on a bootable disk.</li>
        
    <li>Hardware required for digital forensics includes workstations and devices, such as write-blockers, to prevent contamination of evidence. Before you purchase or build a forensic workstation, consider where you acquire data, which determines the hardware configuration you need.</li>
        
    <li>Tools that run in Windows and other GUI environments don’t require the same level of computing expertise as command-line tools and can simplify training and investigations.</li>
        
    <li>Before upgrading to a new version of a forensics tool, run a validation test on the new version. The National Institute of Standards and Technology has standard guidelines for verifying forensics tools.</li>
    </ul>
