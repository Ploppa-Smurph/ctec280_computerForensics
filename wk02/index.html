<b>Summary</b>
<ul>
     <li>Digital forensics applies forensics procedures to digital evidence. This process involves systematically accumulating and analyzing digital information for use as evidence in civil, criminal, and administrative cases. Digital forensics differs from network forensics and data recovery in scope, technique, and objective.
        Laws relating to digital evidence were established in the 1970s.
        To be a successful digital forensics investigator, you must be familiar with more than one computing platform. Develop and maintain contact with computer, network, and investigative professionals to supplement your knowledge.
        Investigators need specialized workstations to examine digital evidence, including additional bays for evidence drives, forensics software and write blockers.
        Public-sector and private-sector investigations differ in that public-sector investigations typically require a search warrant before seizing digital evidence. The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and similar legislation in other countries apply to government search and seizure. During public-sector investigations, you search for evidence to support criminal allegations. During private-sector investigations, your search for evidence to support allegations of policy violations, abuse of assets, and, in some cases, criminal complaints.
        Warning banners should be used to remind employees and visitors of company policy on a computer, e-mail, and Internet use.
        Companies should define and limit the number of authorized requesters who can start an investigation.
        Digital forensics investigators must maintain professional conduct to protect their credibility.
        Always use a systematic approach to your investigations. Follow the checklist in this chapter as a guideline for your case.
        When planning a case, take into account the nature of the case, instructions from the requester, what additional tools and expertise you might need, and how you will acquire the evidence.
        Criminal cases and company-policy violations should be handled in much the same manner to ensure that quality evidence is presented. Both criminal cases and company policy violations can go to court.
        When you begin a case, there might be unanticipated challenges that weren't obvious when applying a systematic approach to your investigation plan. For all investigations, you need to plan for contingencies for any unexpected problems you might encounter.
        You should create a standard evidence custody form to track the chain of custody of evidence for your case. There are two types of forms: a multi-evidence form and a single-evidence form.
        Internet abuse investigations require examining server log data.
        For attorney-client privilege cases, all written communication should have a header label stating that its privileged communication and a confidential work product.
        A bit-stream copy is a bit-by-bit duplicate of the original disk. You should use the duplicate whenever possible when analyzing evidence.
        Always maintain a journal to record exactly what you did when handling evidence.
        You should always critique your own work to determine what improvements you made during each case, what could have been done differently, and how to apply those lessons to future cases.</li>
