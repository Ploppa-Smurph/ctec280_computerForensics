    <h3>11.07a Chapter Summary</h3>
    - E-mail fraudsters use phishing, pharming, and spoofing scam techniques. Phishing e-mails typically lure users to sites or ask for sensitive information. Pharming e-mails redirect users to Web sites that look like legitimate businesses or official government Web sites and solicit personal identity information from victims.
    - In both Internet and intranet e-mail environments, e-mail messages are distributed from one central server to connected client computers, a configuration called a client/server architecture. The server uses server e-mail software to provide e-mail services. Client computers use e-mail programs (also called e-mail clients) to contact the e-mail server and send and retrieve e-mails.
    - Investigating crimes or policy violations involving e-mail is similar to investigating other types of computer abuse and crimes. Your goal is to find out who’s behind the crime, collect the evidence, and build a case.
    - Forensics linguistics is a field where language and the law intersect to determine the author of e-mails, text messages, and other online communications; it encompasses civil cases, criminal cases, cyberterrorism cases, and other legal proceedings. Evidence from forensic linguists is now accepted in many courts worldwide. Forensic linguists can determine, for example, whether a certain person actually wrote an e-mail, where he or she might be from, and in some cases, his or her original language or dialect.
    - After determining that a crime has been committed involving e-mail, access the victim’s computer, if possible, and then use the installed e-mail program to find the e-mail the victim received. Next, copy and print the e-mail. You might also want to forward the message to another e-mail address, depending on your organization’s guidelines.
    - Investigators use e-mail headers to trace the route e-mails take through servers. They can also use this information to determine who really sent an e-mail or pinpoint the sender’s location.
    - To find an e-mail header, investigators generally use the e-mail program that created the message. The header provides supporting evidence and can help track a suspect to an e-mail’s originating location by finding the domain or IP address. Also helpful are the date and time a message was sent, the filenames of any attachments, and the unique ID number, if it’s supplied. With the originating e-mail address, investigators can track a message to a suspect by doing reverse lookups.
    - To investigate e-mail abuse, you should know how an e-mail server records and handles e-mail. Some e-mail servers use databases that store users’ e-mails; others use a flat file system. E-mail servers also maintain a log (by default or through configuration settings) of all e-mails that are processed.
    - For many e-mail investigations, you can rely on e-mail files, e-mail headers, and e-mail server log files. However, if the e-mail administrator isn’t willing to turn over records and files, or you encounter a highly customized e-mail environment, you can use data recovery tools and forensics tools designed to recover e-mail files.
    - For other e-mail applications that use the mbox format, a hexadecimal editor can be used to carve messages manually. This technique requires perseverance because it’s tedious and time consuming.
    - Social media, or online social networks (OSNs), can provide evidence in criminal and civil cases, so software for collecting OSN information is being developed. Because of the variety and amount of data involved in OSN investigations, techniques of big data analytics are usually needed.
    - The majority of people engaging in social media communications are mobile users. Almost all mobile devices store data in a SQLite database, but evidence artifacts vary depending on the social media channel and the device.
    - Social media forensics tools have evolved with the technology, and many forensics suites have built-in social media tools. They’re designed to access Facebook, Twitter, and other OSN user accounts and examine pictures, postings, videos, friend lists, and so forth. These tools can be used to find out which people users have been in touch with, when, and how often.

<h2>12.04 Chapter Review</h2>
    <h3>12.04a Chapter Summary</h3>
    - People store a wealth of information on smartphones, including calls, text messages, picture and music files, address books, and more. These files can give you a lot of information when investigating cases.
    - Mobile devices have gone through four generations: analog, digital personal communications service (PCS), third-generation (3G), and fourth-generation (4G). Two major digital networks currently used in the United States are Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) and Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM).
    - 4G technology is the current generation of mobile phones. It has faster data transfer rates than previous generations.
    - 5G standards are being negotiated and developed by the IMT 2020 working group of the International Telecommunications Union. They are in three categories: enhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB), Ultra-reliable and Low-latency Communications (uRLLC), and massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC).
    - Mobile devices range from basic, inexpensive phones used primarily for phone calls to smartphones that integrate a phone, PDA, camera, music player, and more into one device.
    - Data can be retrieved from several different places in phones, including volatile memory, nonvolatile memory, and Secure Digital, MultiMediaCard, and Compact Flash cards.
    - The use of personal digital assistants (PDAs) has declined because smartphones incorporated all their features and added more. They’re still used for specialized applications, such as medical and industrial PDAs.
    - As you do with computers, you must follow correct search and seizure procedures for mobile devices. In particular, investigators must take care to ensure that mobile devices remain connected to a power source so that they don’t lose data in volatile memory. Also, suspect devices should be disconnected from PCs as soon as possible to prevent any synchronization that might overwrite data on the device.
    - To isolate a mobile device from incoming messages, you can put it in airplane mode, turn the device off, or place it in a specially treated paint can or evidence bag.
    - SIM cards store data in a hierarchical file structure containing a system root, which holds directory files that store elementary data.
    - Mobile device forensics is becoming more important as these devices grow in popularity. Accessing backup files from the cloud or SIM cards is the easiest way to retrieve information from these devices, but acquiring an image is more accurate and produces more detailed data.
    - Many software tools are available for reading data stored in mobile devices. Typically, these devices connect to the phone wirelessly (through Bluetooth or irDA) or with a cable. Some also read SIM cards by using a SIM card reader, which is a combination hardware/software device.
    - The Internet of Things (IoT) has resulted in yet another challenge for digital forensics investigators. The number of devices that connect to the Internet is expected to reach 50 billion in the next few decades. Because mobile devices and appliances are so interconnected, determining a timeline or who actually performed an action can be difficult. In addition, collecting information from wearable computers will pose many new challenges for investigators.
