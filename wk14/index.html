    <h3>15.05a Module Summary</h3>
    - When cases go to trial, you as the forensics expert play one of two roles: a fact witness or an expert witness. As a fact witness, you’re providing only the facts you discovered in your investigation. However, as an expert witness, you have opinions about what you have observed. In fact, it’s your opinion that makes you an expert witness.
    - If you’re called as a fact witness or an expert witness in a digital forensics case, you need to prepare for your testimony thoroughly. Establish communication early with your attorney. Substantiate your findings with your own documentation and by collaborating with other digital forensics professionals.
    - When you’re called to testify in court, your attorney examines you on your qualifications to establish your competency as an expert witness or a fact witness. Opposing counsel might attempt to discredit you based on your past record. Your attorney then leads you through the evidence, followed by the opposing counsel cross-examining you. Redirect examinations and recross examinations of limited scope might follow.
    - Make sure you’re prepared for questions opposing counsel might use to discredit you, confuse you, or throw you off the track. Stay calm and project professionalism in your behavior and appearance.
    - Know whether you’re being called as a fact witness or an expert witness (or both) and whether you’re being retained as a consulting expert or expert witness. Also, be familiar with the contents of your curriculum vitae.
    - A deposition differs from a trial because there’s no jury or judge. Both attorneys and a court reporter are present, and the attorney asks you questions. There are two types of depositions: discovery and testimony preservation. Testimony preservation depositions are often recorded.
    - Hearings are typically administrative hearings or judicial hearings. Guidelines for testifying at depositions and hearings are much the same as the guidelines for courtroom testimony. Keep in mind that attorneys at discovery depositions might be more combative, so striving to maintain a calm, professional appearance can be critical. Discovery depositions are designed to elicit relevant evidence or testimony that might lead to relevant evidence, so the capacity to object effectively is very limited.
    - Make sure you prepare answers for questions on what steps you took to collect and analyze evidence and questions on what tools you used and how they work.
