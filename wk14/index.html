    <h3>15.05a Module Summary</h3>
    - When cases go to trial, you as the forensics expert play one of two roles: a fact witness or an expert witness. As a fact witness, you’re providing only the facts you discovered in your investigation. However, as an expert witness, you have opinions about what you have observed. In fact, it’s your opinion that makes you an expert witness.
    - If you’re called as a fact witness or an expert witness in a digital forensics case, you need to prepare for your testimony thoroughly. Establish communication early with your attorney. Substantiate your findings with your own documentation and by collaborating with other digital forensics professionals.
    - When you’re called to testify in court, your attorney examines you on your qualifications to establish your competency as an expert witness or a fact witness. Opposing counsel might attempt to discredit you based on your past record. Your attorney then leads you through the evidence, followed by the opposing counsel cross-examining you. Redirect examinations and recross examinations of limited scope might follow.
    - Make sure you’re prepared for questions opposing counsel might use to discredit you, confuse you, or throw you off the track. Stay calm and project professionalism in your behavior and appearance.
    - Know whether you’re being called as a fact witness or an expert witness (or both) and whether you’re being retained as a consulting expert or expert witness. Also, be familiar with the contents of your curriculum vitae.
    - A deposition differs from a trial because there’s no jury or judge. Both attorneys and a court reporter are present, and the attorney asks you questions. There are two types of depositions: discovery and testimony preservation. Testimony preservation depositions are often recorded.
    - Hearings are typically administrative hearings or judicial hearings. Guidelines for testifying at depositions and hearings are much the same as the guidelines for courtroom testimony. Keep in mind that attorneys at discovery depositions might be more combative, so striving to maintain a calm, professional appearance can be critical. Discovery depositions are designed to elicit relevant evidence or testimony that might lead to relevant evidence, so the capacity to object effectively is very limited.
    - Make sure you prepare answers for questions on what steps you took to collect and analyze evidence and questions on what tools you used and how they work.

<h2>16.05 Module Review</h2>
    <h3>16.05a Module Summary</h3>
    - Ethics can be defined as rules you internalize and use to measure your performance (internal standards) or standards that you’re compelled to adhere to by external forces, such as licensing bodies (codes of professional conduct or responsibility). Laws governing codes of professional conduct or responsibility typically define the lowest level of action or performance required to avoid liability.
    - Digital forensics examiners don’t have the same formal, detailed codes of conduct that professions such as medicine and the law have, so relying on an internal code of ethics might be more critical. Additional sources include codes of professional associations you belong to, certifying bodies that have granted you a certification, and your employer’s rules of professional conduct. Most examiners rely on a combination of these standards to construct their professional ethical codes.
    - You owe your client a full understanding of the facts relevant to your opinion, and you can ask him or her to establish that there’s evidence supporting the facts your opinion is based on.
    - Be aware of attempts to disqualify you as an expert. Opposing counsel might attempt to disqualify you based on any deviations from opinions you’ve given in previous cases, so be prepared to explain the reason for any changes in your position. Some attorneys might contact you solely for the purpose of discrediting or disqualifying you (conflicting out). Always note calls from attorneys and the nature of the communication, and require that the attorney complete a client questionnaire and send you an investigation retainer.
    - Courts use many factors in determining whether to disqualify an expert, such as whether an expert was formally retained and compensated, whether an expert was informed that discussions were confidential, and so on.
    - Be aware of obvious ethical errors, such as ignoring contradictory data, performing work beyond your expertise or competence, allowing the attorney who hired you to influence your opinion improperly, and reaching a conclusion before completing your research.
    - No single source offers a definitive code of ethics for expert witnesses, so you must draw on standards from other organizations to form your own ethical standards. Many professional organizations, such as the ABA and APA, have rules to guide their members in areas such as interaction with patients/clients, objectivity, role in society, fees, solicitation, independence, and contractual relationships.
    - The International Society of Forensic Computer Examiners (ISFCE) Code of Ethics and Professional Responsibility provides guidelines for its members, and the International Association of Computer Investigative Specialists (IACIS) has a well-defined, simple guide for the expected behavior of forensics examiners.
    - The inherent conflict between the needs of the justice system and your obligations for professional conduct can create ethical difficulties. With an adversarial legal system, pressures from hiring attorneys, and a tendency to identify with the side you’re working for, maintaining impartiality can be difficult. Digital forensics examiners should consider their personal values, review the codes of conduct that apply to other professions, and develop a personal code of conduct that will protect them from ethical errors.
    - The attorney who has retained you, opposing counsel, and the court owe you ethical responsibilities as an expert witness. For example, your attorney owes you a fair statement of the case or situation, adequate time to review evidence and prepare your report, and a reasonable opportunity to examine data, conduct testing, and investigate the matter before rendering an opinion.
    - As a forensics examiner, you deal with attorneys, so be aware of the basic rules of professional conduct they must follow. The American Bar Association is not a licensing body, but its Model Code of Professional Responsibility (Model Code) and its successor, the Model Rules of Professional Conduct (Model Rules), are the basis of state licensing bodies’ codes.
    - To give reliable and valid testimony, an expert has the ethical responsibility to present a complete, unbiased picture of the research related to the case. With an adversarial system, pressures from hiring attorneys, and a tendency to identify with the side you’re working for, educating impartially is difficult.
    - The attorney who has retained you, opposing counsel, and the court also owe you ethical responsibilities as an expert witness.
    - The tools you use to recover, control, and track evidence are subject to review by opposing parties. If the court deems them unreliable, the evidence you recovered with those tools might not be admitted or be admitted with a limiting instruction. If you create tools for your own use, you must still validate them and submit them for review.
    - After carving data artifacts, analyzing as much of the information as possible is critical. This information includes the create, modified, last access, and record timestamps in a recovered MFT record in addition to any recovered data runs. Collecting as many facts as possible provides more complete findings for your final report.
