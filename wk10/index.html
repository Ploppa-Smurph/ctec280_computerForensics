<h2>09.04 Chapter Review</h2>
    <h3>09.04a Chapter Summary</h3>
    - Examining and analyzing digital evidence depend on the nature of the investigation and the amount of data to process. You begin a forensics case by creating an investigation plan that defines the investigation’s goal and scope, the materials needed, and the tasks to perform. Depending on the evidence you find, you might have to modify your investigation plan at some point.
    - For most forensics investigations, you follow the same general procedures: Wipe and prepare target drives, document all hardware components on the suspect’s computer, check date and time values in the suspect computer’s CMOS, acquire data and document your steps, list all folders and files on the suspect system and examine their contents, attempt to open any password-protected files, determine the function of executable files, and document all your steps, making sure to follow evidence preservation procedures.
    - Advanced digital forensics tools have features such as indexing text data that make keyword searches much faster. They also allow integrating the NIST National Software Resource Library (NSRL) to get MD5 and SHA-1 hash values for known OSs and applications.
    - One of the most critical aspects of digital forensics is validating digital evidence because ensuring the integrity of data you collect is essential for presenting evidence in court. Forensics tools have built-in validation features, but hexadecimal editors offer more advanced features. All data needs to be validated before and during analysis because digital evidence can be corrupted easily. Use hash values such as MD5 and SHA-1 to verify that data hasn’t changed.
    - Data hiding involves changing or manipulating a file to conceal information. Data-hiding techniques include changing file extensions, setting file attributes to hidden, hiding partitions, bit-shifting, using steganography, and using encryption and password protection.
    - There are three ways to recover passwords: dictionary attacks, brute-force attacks, and rainbow tables. Rainbow tables are the quickest method because they contain predefined hash values of all known passwords. If passwords have been salted, however, recovering them can take much longer, and some might not be recoverable at all.

    <h3>09.04c Review Questions</h3>
    <b>01) Block-wise hashing has which of the following benefits for forensics examiners?</b>
       <i>Provides a method for hashing sectors of a known good file that can be used to search for data remnants on a suspect's drive</i>

    <b>02) The likelihood that a brute-force attack can succeed in cracking a password depends heavily on the password length.</b>
        <i>True</i>

    <b>03) Rainbow tables serve what purpose for digital forensics examinations?</b>
        <i>Rainbow tables contain computed hashes of possible passwords that some password-recovery programs can use to crack passwords.</i>

    <b>04) After you shift a file's bits, the hash value remains the same.</b>
        <i>False</i>

    <b>05) In steganalysis, cover-media is which of the following?</b>
        <i>The file a steganography tool uses to host a hidden message, such as a JPEG or an MP3 file</i>

    <b>06) Password recovery is included in all forensics tools.</b>
        <i>False</i>

    <b>07) If an application uses salting when creating passwords, what concerns should a forensics examiner have when attempting to recover passwords?</b>
        <i>Salting can make password recovery extremely difficult and time consuming.</i>

    <b>08) Commercial encryption programs often rely on key escrow technology to recover files if a password or passphrase is lost.</b>
        <i>True</i>

    <b>09) The National Software Reference Library provides what type of resource for digital forensics examiners?</b>
        <i>A list of MD5 and SHA1 hash values for all known OSs and applications</i>

    <b>10) Scope creep happens when an investigation goes beyond the bounds of its original description.</b>
        <i>True</i>
